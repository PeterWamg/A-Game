# A-Game
Blackjack, a game played by 2 to 6 people, uses 52 cards other than King and King, and the player's goal is to keep the total number of cards in their hands no more than 21 points and as large as possible.
This is a game written by Rust that simulates Blackjack. The rules of the game are as follows: 
1 Each player is dead two cards initially
2. The goal is to get a hand total as close to 21 as possible without exceeding it
3. Numbered cards are worth their face value, face cards (Jack, Queen, King) are worth 10, and Aces can be worth 1 or 11â€œ
4. Players can choose to 'Hit' (draw a card) or 'Stand' (keep their current hand)
5. If a player's total exceptions 21, they lose If the dealer's total exceptions 21, the player wins
6. If neither the player nor the dealer exceptions 21, the one with the closed total to 21 wins
7. A 'push' occurrences if the player and dealer have the same total, and no one wins
